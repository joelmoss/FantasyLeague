# Fantasy League Rules

### Scoring Points

Your team will score points based upon how your chosen players perform in Barclays Premier League matches.

Only players who are in your starting 11 at the scheduled kick-off time for a game they are participating in will score points for that match, players on your bench at the scheduled kick-off time will not score points for that fixture block.

Substitutes do not score any points for your team.

Points are awarded to players as follows:

- **All Players**
  - **Goal** - 3 points
  - **Assist** - 2 points

- **Defensive Players** (Goalkeepers and Defenders)
  - **Appearance** - 1 point *(minimum 45 minutes played, excluding injury time)*
  - **Clean Sheet** - 3 points *(minimum 75 minutes played, and includes appearance point)*
  - **Goal Conceded** - -1 point


### Auction

The season begins with the player auction. This is where all manager get together and bid for the players they want in their team. All managers have a fixed budget at the beginning of the auction.

- Budget of £100m.
- Minimum 11, maximum 15 players
- Maximum 2 players per club
- Bids have a minimum increment of £0.5m.
- Bids can start at £0, allowing managers to pick up players on a free transfer if no other managers are interested.
- Managers choose which players to auction, in turn, one player at a time.
- Once you have a full squad (15 players), you are out of the auction, and can no longer bid on any players.
- Once you have a minimum squad size, you do not have to continue in the auction, and may drop out.
- Bidding continues until all managers have either dropped out or do not have any money left.
- When the auction ends, managers who have no money left and do not have a minimum squad of 11 players, and managers who dropped out of the - auction with a squad size less than the maximum 15 players take part in a free transfer round.
- Each manager taking part in the free transfer round, take it in turns to choose a player until they have a minimum of 11 players, and/or maximum of 15.


### Transfers

Managers may buy and sell players at different times throughout the season. Transfers may include money, swaps, both or none (free transfer).

Transfers can be made at any time with a season deadline of March 1st.
Players can be transferred between managers, and can also be released back to the market, but doing so will not bring the team any money.

#### Free Agents

A player who does not play for a team is known as a Free Agent. Free Agents can be bought by managers at any time via sealed bids.

- Sealed Bids are accepted on a weekly basis, with a deadline of Sunday at 9pm.
- All sealed bids are opened after the deadline, with the highest bid winning the player being bid upon.
- There is no minimum or maximum amounts for sealed bids, but you cannot bid more than your current budget.
- In the event of a tie of sealed bids, the manager with the lowest league position will be win the bid.

#### New Players

New players may arrive into the Premier League at various times throughout the season (usually during transfer windows). When this happens, these players may be made available and added to the player list as a free agent.

#### Removed Players

Players may be removed from the player list at any time. This will usually be because the player is no longer playing for a Premier League club due to being sold or retiring. When this happens, and when such a player is part of a team, that player is removed.

- If the removal of a player results in a squad size less than the minimum, the manager must transfer a new player in from the free agent market.
- No money is received for removed players.


### Substitutions

Substitutions can be made at any time, but will only be applied at 11pm of each day. This means that if you make a substitution at 2pm on a saturday, it will only be applied at 11pm that same day. So be sure to make your substitutions the day before the match!

Players not in your starting lineup, will not score any points.

### Formations

Allowed formations: 4-4-2, 4-5-1, 5-3-2, and 4-3-3.

Just like subs, formation changes can take place at any time, but will only be applied at 11pm of each day.
