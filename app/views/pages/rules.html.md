# Fantasy League Rules

### Scoring Points

Your team will score points based upon how your chosen players perform in Barclays Premier League matches.

Only players who are in your starting 11 midnight will score points for matches they play in the following day (24 hours). Players on your bench at the scheduled kick-off time will not score points for that day.

Substitutes do not score any points for your team.

Points are awarded to players as follows:

- **All Players**
  - **Goal** - 3 points
  - **Assist** - 2 points

- **Defensive Players** (Goalkeepers and Defenders)
  - **Appearance** - 1 point *(minimum 45 minutes played, excluding injury time)*
  - **Clean Sheet** - 3 points *(minimum 75 minutes played, and includes appearance point)*
  - **Goal Conceded** - -1 point


### Transfers

Managers may buy, sell and swap players at any time throughout the season.

- Transfers may include money, swaps, both or none (free transfer).
- Transfers can be made at any time with a season deadline of March 1st.
- Players can be transferred between managers, and can also be released back to the market, but doing so will not bring the team any money.

#### Free Agents

A player who does not play for a team is known as a Free Agent. Free Agents can be bought by managers at any time via sealed bids.

- Sealed Bids are accepted on a weekly basis, with a deadline of Sunday at 9pm.
- All sealed bids are opened after the deadline, with the highest bid winning the player being bid upon.
- There is no minimum or maximum amounts for sealed bids, but you cannot bid more than your current budget.
- In the event of a tie of sealed bids, the manager with the lowest league position will win the bid.

#### New Players

New players may arrive into the Premier League at various times throughout the season (usually during transfer windows). When this happens, these players may be made available and added to the player list as free agents. They can then be bought using a sealed bid (see above).

#### Removed Players

Players may be removed from the player list at any time. This will usually be because the player is no longer playing for a Premier League club due to being sold or retiring. When this happens, and when such a player is part of a team, that player is removed.

- If the removal of a player results in a squad size less than the minimum, the manager must transfer a new player in from the free agent market.
- No money is received for removed players.


### Substitutions

Substitutions can be made at any time, but will only be applied at midnight of each day. This means that if you make a substitution at 2pm on a Saturday, it will only be applied at midnight that same evening. So be sure to make your substitutions the day before the match!

Players not in your starting line-up, will not score any points.

### Formations

Allowed formations: 4-4-2, 4-5-1, 5-3-2, and 4-3-3.

Just like subs, formation changes can take place at any time, but will only be applied at midnight of each day.

- The **4-4-2** formation consists of one goalkeeper, two full-backs, two centre-backs, four midfielders and two strikers.
- The **5-3-2** formation consists of one goalkeeper, two full-backs, three centre-backs, three midfielders and two strikers.
- The **4-5-1** formation consists of one goalkeeper, two full-backs, two centre-backs, five midfielders and one striker.
- The **5-4-1** formation consists of one goalkeeper, two full-backs, three centre-backs, four midfielders and one striker.
- The **4-3-3** formation consists of one goalkeeper, two full-backs, two centre-backs, three midfielders and three strikers.

### Team Income

Each week (Monday thru Sunday), the team with most points scored in that week will receive a monetary bonus of &pound;1m. The runner up will receive &pound;0.5m, and the 3rd placed team &pound;0.2m.

Each calendar month, the team with most points scored in that month will receive a monetary bonus of &pound;2m. The runner up will receive &pound;1m, and the 3rd placed team &pound;0.5m.
