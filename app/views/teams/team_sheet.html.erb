    <strong>Your Team Sheet is locked down at midnight each day</strong>, and is built from your starting 11 players (not including subs). The total points scored by these players today (midnight to midnight) will be added to your team's total points. So if you wish to make substitution or formation changes for any matches, you must do so before midnight of the previous evening.
