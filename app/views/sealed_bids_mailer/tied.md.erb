Hi <%= @bid.manager %>,

Sorry to say, but your Sealed Bid of **<%= @bid.bid %>m** for <%= url_for @bid.player %> was
unsuccessful. One or more managers bid the same highest bid, so the result was a tie.

The player is still a free agent, and you may place a new sealed bid for next week's deadline.

Better luck next time ;)
